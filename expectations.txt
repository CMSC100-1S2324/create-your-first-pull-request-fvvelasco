||Expectations on CMSC 100 course||

Coming into this class, I don't have much knowledge nor experience on 
web development. Due to this I wouldn't know much what to expect for this course.
After reading the course outline, most of the topics I see are new to me other
than the reviewing of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Hopefully, it wouldn't be too bumpy on trying to learn web development this
semester with the help of this course and professor who is Sir Carl.
