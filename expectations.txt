||Expectations on CMSC 100 course||

Coming into this class, I didn't have much knowledge and experience on 
web development. Due to this I wouldn't know much what to expect for 
this course. After reading the course outline, most of the topics I 
see are new to me otherthan the reviewing of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Hopefully it wouldn't be too bumpy on trying to learn web development this
semester with the help of this course and professor who is Sir Carl.
